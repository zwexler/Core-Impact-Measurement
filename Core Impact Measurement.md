# Core Innovation Capital Impact Measurement Methodology

## Executive Summary
Core Innovation Capital measures the social impact of its portfolio companies in three broad categories: quality, scale, and alignment. 

Quality captures the degree to which a company is or will generate impactful outcomes for individuals. 
Quality is divided into three measures: value created per user per month, the level to which the company is to connected to external impact stakeholders, and an assessment of the company's social impact traction and potential.

Scale captures the number of individuals benefiting from the company's operations and how well the company is serving Core's target demographic of indiviudals in the bottom three quintiles of income.

Alignment captures the depth of connection between the company's business model and its social impact and the degree to which the company is actively monitoring its social impact.

Each of these measures has an associated methodology to arrive at a value or score for each portfolio company. 
Each is also assigned a weight according to Core's priorities in order to enable aggregation to a company-level and portfolio-level scores.

Core's impact measurement approach can be summarized by the following table:

## Quality
Quality captures the degree to which a company is or will generate impactful outcomes for individuals. 
### Value Creation
Value creation is measured as the cost savings, wealth creation, or risk mitigation provided to the company's users.
Measuring value creation is highly specific to each company, and therefore requires a deep understanding of the business model of each portfolio company.
However, there is a general process to be followed. First, the cost, wealth benefit, or risk mitigation of the portfolio company is approximated by a dollar value on a per active user basis. 
Then, the next best alternative product in the market is identified as a benchmark. 
The cost, wealth benefit, or risk mitigation of the benchmark product is approximated by a dollar value on a per active user basis.
Finally, the cost, wealth benefit, or risk mitigation of the benchmark is compared to that of the portfolio company to arrive that value creation for the portfolio company.

For companies being evaluated based on cost savings, measurement usually entails simply comparing the cost of the company's product to the cost of the most similar alternative product available.
For example, the cost savings value of a lender may be calculated by comparing the average interest rate of the lender to its nearest competitor offering similarly structured loans.

For companies being evaluated based on wealth creation, measurement usually entails calculating the value of wealth created by using the product and comparing it to the user's most likely alternative, which is often simply the absence of the product.
For example, the wealth creation value of a product enabling access to a new asset class may be calculated by comparing the new rate of return available to consumers to the likely rate of return without using the product.

For companies being evaluated based on risk mitigation, measurement usually entails comparing the cost of the company's product to the probability weighted cost of not using the product.
For example, the risk mitigation value of a home insurance company may involve comparing the cost of the home insurance premium to the probability weighted cost of being uninsured and incurring a loss.

If the company is being measured by costs savings, it is assigned a **Value Creation Score** according to the following schedule:

If the company is being measured by wealth creation, scoring is determined by materiality buckets. 
Materiality is defined as the company's ability to facilitate 2% in new wealth creation per user relative to average user income.
The company is assigned a **Value Creation Score** according to the following schedule:

If the company is being measured by risk mitigation, scores are once again determined by materiality buckets.
Materiality is defined as the company's ability to facilitate a 2% improvement in risk mitigation per user relative to the average user income.
The company is assigned a **Value Creation Score** according to the following schedule:

### Impact Stakeholders
Impact stakeholders are individuals or entities that are connected to the company that have an explicit focus on social impact. 
The company is assigned an **Impact Stakeholders Score** according to the following schedule:

![img_7.png](img_7.png)

### Impact Traction
Impact traction is the degree to which the company has already demonstrated its ability to create positive change or its potential to do so.
Companies are assessed by the Financial Health Network across four categories of financial health: spend, save, borrow, and plan.

Spend is evaluated according to the impact on spending as a portion of income and the impact on one's ability to pay bills on time.

Save is evaluated according to the impact on liquid savings, the impact on long-term savings, and the degree to which the solution is scalable.

Borrow is evaluated according to the impact on one's ability to handle their debt load, the impact on one's credit score, and the degree to which the impact is enduring.

Plan is evaluated according to the impact on insurance coverage, the impact on financing planning, and the degree to which the impact is enduring.

The company is assigned a score for each of these categories according to the following schedule:

![img_10.png](img_10.png)

The company is also given a traction score based on the maturity of the business. 
The company is assigned a score for traction according to the following schedule:

![img_9.png](img_9.png)

The overall **Impact Traction Score** is calculated by averaging the spend, save, borrow, plan, and traction scores.

## Scale
Scale captures the number of individuals benefiting from the company's operations and how well the company is serving Core's target demographic of indiviudals in the bottom two quintiles of income.

### Individuals Served
In order to measure the scale dimension of impact, the total number of active users must be identified.
Active users should be those individuals or entities that are currently participating in the company's business and reflect the same unit used to calculate value creation per user from value creation stage.
The total number of active users identified is then compared to a previously determined goal active user goal for the company.
The company is assigned a **Individuals Served Score** according to the following schedule:

![img_13.png](img_13.png)

### Target Demographic
After identifying the size of the active user base, the percentage of users in each income quintile is determined according to the buckets published by the US Census Bureau.
Attributing the user base by income quintile can be difficult. Often the best approach is use approximations provided by the company or to make assumptions based on user geography or other demographics.
Once the percentage of users in each income quintile are determined, the company is assigned a **Target Demographic Score** according to the following schedule:

![img_11.png](img_11.png)

## Alignment
Alignment captures the depth of connection between the company's business model and its social impact and the degree to which the company is actively monitoring its social impact.
### Revenue/Savings Correlation
If a company has three or more years of available revenue and savings per user data, the correlation between annual savings per customer and annual revenue is calculated using all years of available data.
The company is assigned a **Revenue/Savings Correlation Score** according to the following schedule:

![img_12.png](img_12.png)

If the necessary three years of data is not available to calculate the correlation, the company is assigned a score of 1-10 for each of the Financial Health Network's Compass Principles: embrace inclusion, build trust, promote success, create opportunity.
The company is also assigned an impact probability by the Financial Health Network.
The company is assigned a **Revenue/Savings Correlation Score** by averaging the Compass Principles scores and mutiplying by the impact probability.

### Impact KPI
The company is assigned a **Impact KPI Score** of 0 or 10 according to whether it actively monitors at least one impact KPI.

## Aggregation
Through the processes described above, each company is assigned a score for each of the dimensions described in Figure 1.
It is important to note that certain scores are allowed to exceed 10 to allow performance beyond expectations to balance with opportunities for improvement.
This applies to the three measures of Quality and the two measures of Scale.

### Company Level
For each company, the **Quality Score** is calculated according to the following formula:

*Quality Score = (Value Creation Score + Impact Stakeholders Score + Impact Traction Score)/3* 

For each company, the **Scale Score** is calculated according to the following formula:

*Scale Score = (Individuals Served Score + Target Demographic Score)/2*

For each company, the **Alignment Score** is calculated according to the following formula:

*Alignment Score = (Revenue Savings Correlation Score + Impact KPI Score)/2*

For each company, a **Company Impact Score** is assigned according to the following formula:

*Company Impact Score = Quality Score * 0.4 + Scale Score * 0.4 + Alignment Score * 0.2*

### Portfolio Level
The portfolio is assigned a **Portfolio Quality Score** by averaging the Quality Scores of each company with available data.

The portfolio is assigned a **Portfolio Scale Score** by averaging the Scale Scores of each company with available data.

The portfolio is assigned an **Portfolio Alignment Score** by averaging the Alignment Scores of each company with available data.

The portfolio is assigned a **Portfolio Impact Score** according to the following formula:

*Portfolio Impact Score = Portfolio Quality Score * 0.4 + Portfolio Scale Score * 0.4 + Portfolio Alignment Score * 0.2*

## Exceptions
### Exited Companies
Data for exited companies carried over from the last year it was included in the portfolio, without an increase or decrease.
It is unreasonable to take credit any impact growth that occurs after an exit, yet it is also unreasonable to assume the company is no longer creating impact.
Exited companies are judged in value creation and scale but not in any of the other measures.

### Business Model and Stage
Companies that are too nascent to meaningfully assess or those whose business model precludes measuring quantifiable savings are excluded.

### Ownership
Companies in which ownership stake is not enough to solicit information or to be influential are excluded.
